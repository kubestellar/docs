![UI splash page](kubestellar_splash_screen.png)

The KubeStellar UI is an add-on developed to make managing workloads via KubeStellar even simpler and more intuitive.
With its web-based interface, you can view and manage your Workload Definition Space, Inventory and Transport Space, and Binding Policies all interactively, with both drag-and-drop and text-based interface modes available for use.

## Console Features

### Global Filtering

The KubeStellar Console now features a powerful **Global Filtering** system located in the navbar, allowing you to filter resources across all dashboard cards and pages simultaneously.

- **Global Status Filter**: Filter your view by resource status (e.g., `Running`, `Failed`, `Pending`, `Initializing`). This helps you quickly identify issues across your entire fleet.
- **Custom Text Filter**: Use the search bar to filter resources by Name, Namespace, or Cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> Your filter preferences are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so they persist between sessions.
