# ADR-0010: Escalation circuit breaker for CI fix loops

Status: Accepted (retroactive)

## Context

Hive agents can repair their own failing PRs, but an unbounded retry loop can
keep re-dispatching blind fixes without surfacing the root CI error. The
escalation package records the incident that forced this boundary: a console
test split kept `main` red for days while scanner fix PRs missed the one-line
failure in shard logs ([escalation package](https://github.com/kubestellar/hive/blob/v4/src/pkg/escalation/escalation.go)).

## Decision

Track red PRs in a persistent ledger keyed by `repo#number`. Each sweep records
distinct failing head SHAs, retains the last CI excerpt, clears history when a
PR goes green, and marks escalation once the threshold is crossed. The default
threshold is three distinct red SHAs. When escalation fires, Hive posts a comment
headed "Fix loop escalated — human attention needed", includes failing checks
and raw failure evidence when available, and applies the `needs-human` label so
future fix dispatch skips the PR.

For unchanged red heads, track staleness separately and cap re-engagements at
three per current SHA. A branch that moves resets the re-engagement counter; a
permanently red, never-moving branch is not nudged forever.

## Consequences

The fleet stops spending cycles on fix loops that are not converging and gives a
human the evidence needed to unblock the PR. The ledger is deterministic and
language-agnostic: it keys on CI state, head SHAs, and elapsed time rather than
agent judgment. The trade-off is that some recoverable failures will require
manual label removal after the cap, and stale/failure detection depends on the
quality of CI observations and excerpts available during enumeration.
