# ACMM Policy Matrix

## Policy Modes

Each agent runs in one of four modes, controlling what actions it can take on GitHub.

| Mode | Suffix | Beads | Issues | PRs | Merge | GH Auth |
|------|--------|-------|--------|-----|-------|---------|
| **Advisory** | `-advisory.md` | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| **Measured** | `-measured.md` | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Holdgated** | `-holdgated.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes + `hold` label | No | Yes |
| **Full** | `-full.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (auto on green CI) | Yes |

- **Advisory**: Agent observes and records findings as beads on the dashboard. No GitHub interaction.
- **Measured**: Agent can file GitHub issues to make findings visible to the team. No code changes.
- **Holdgated**: Agent can write code and open PRs, but every PR gets a `hold` label. A human must review and remove `hold` before merge. Agent never merges.
- **Full**: Agent operates autonomously — opens PRs and merges on green CI. Highest trust level.

## ACMM Levels

### L1 — Inception (Assisted) (2 agents)

A single interactive advisor helps with repo setup and architecture decisions. Guide agent makes advisory beads. Brainstorm agent handles project inception — turning raw ideas into structured KB facts and scaffold. No feedback loops. See the [Inception operator guide](https://github.com/kubestellar/hive/blob/v4/src/docs/inception.md) for the end-to-end workflow and API reference.

| Agent | Mode | Template |
|-------|------|----------|
| guide | advisory | `guide-advisory.md` |
| brainstorm | advisory | `brainstorm-advisory.md` |

### L2 — Advisory (Instructed) (5 agents)

Agents observe and report findings as advisory beads on the dashboard and tracking issue. No GitHub issues or PRs created. Humans decide what to act on.

| Agent | Mode | Template |
|-------|------|----------|
| supervisor | advisory | `supervisor-nogithub.md` |
| scanner | advisory | `scanner-advisory.md` |
| quality | advisory | `quality-advisory.md` |
| guide | advisory | `guide-advisory.md` |
| brainstorm | advisory | `brainstorm-advisory.md` |

### L3 — Quality-Gated (Measured) (6 agents)

Quality agent opens GitHub issues and PRs about testing gaps, coverage, and CI workflows. All other agents remain advisory. CI-maintainer joins to monitor build health. Key artifact: measurement infrastructure.

| Agent | Mode | Template |
|-------|------|----------|
| supervisor | advisory | `supervisor-nogithub.md` |
| scanner | advisory | `scanner-advisory.md` |
| ci-maintainer | advisory | `ci-maintainer-advisory.md` |
| **quality** | **holdgated** | `quality-holdgated.md` |
| guide | advisory | `guide-advisory.md` |
| brainstorm | advisory | `brainstorm-advisory.md` |

### L4 — Security-Aware (Adaptive) (7 agents)

Delivery agents open GitHub issues — bugs, docs gaps, CI problems, security vulnerabilities. Only Quality, sec-check, and ci-maintainer may open PRs. Security agent joins.

| Agent | Mode | Template |
|-------|------|----------|
| supervisor | advisory | `supervisor-nogithub.md` |
| scanner | measured | `scanner-issues.md` |
| ci-maintainer | holdgated | `ci-maintainer-holdgated.md` |
| **quality** | **holdgated** | `quality-holdgated.md` |
| guide | measured | `guide-issues.md` |
| **sec-check** | **holdgated** | `sec-check-holdgated.md` |
| brainstorm | advisory | `brainstorm-advisory.md` |

### L5 — Semi-Autonomous (Semi-Automated) (11 agents)

Agents open issues AND pull requests. All PRs get a hold label — humans batch-review and approve. Architect produces RFCs, strategist coordinates across agents. The system proposes; it does not merge autonomously.

| Agent | Mode | Template |
|-------|------|----------|
| supervisor | advisory | `supervisor-nogithub.md` |
| scanner | holdgated | `scanner-holdgated.md` |
| ci-maintainer | holdgated | `ci-maintainer-holdgated.md` |
| quality | holdgated | `quality-holdgated.md` |
| guide | holdgated | `guide-holdgated.md` |
| sec-check | holdgated | `sec-check-holdgated.md` |
| architect | holdgated | `architect-holdgated.md` |
| strategist | holdgated | `strategist-holdgated.md` |
| telemetry (paused) | holdgated | `telemetry-holdgated.md` |
| operations (paused) | holdgated | `operations-holdgated.md` |
| brainstorm | advisory | `brainstorm-advisory.md` |

### L6 — Fully Autonomous (12 agents)

Existing autonomous lanes can open issues, create PRs, and auto-merge on green CI. No hold label. Outreach handles community engagement. Telemetry and operations remain paused and use `ISSUES_AND_PRS`, so they never merge their own PRs.

| Agent | Mode | Template |
|-------|------|----------|
| supervisor | advisory | `supervisor-nogithub.md` |
| scanner | full | `scanner-automerge.md` |
| ci-maintainer | full | `ci-maintainer-full.md` |
| quality | full | `quality-full.md` |
| guide | full | `guide-full.md` |
| sec-check | full | `sec-check-full.md` |
| architect | full | `architect-full.md` |
| strategist | full | `strategist-full.md` |
| outreach | full | `outreach-full.md` |
| telemetry (paused) | full | `telemetry-full.md` |
| operations (paused) | full | `operations-full.md` |
| brainstorm | advisory | `brainstorm-advisory.md` |

## Example config alignment

`src/hive.yaml.example` uses the built-in `quality` lane for automated test suites, coverage gates, and regression checks. There is no built-in `tester` lane in the ACMM packs, known-agent defaults, or shipped policy templates; operators who want a separate tester must define it as a custom agent with explicit metadata and a policy template.

## Key Rules

1. **All PRs are holdgated below L6.** No agent can auto-merge unless running at L6 (Fully Autonomous).
2. **Advisory agents never get GH auth.** The `${GH_AUTH}` template variable is only injected into measured, holdgated, and full templates.
3. **Supervisor uses no-GitHub advisory mode.** At every level, supervisor uses `supervisor-nogithub.md` in the built-in ACMM packs — it monitors agent health, not code.
4. **Mode escalation is per-agent.** At L4, some agents are measured (issues only) while others are holdgated (issues + PRs). The level defines the mix.
5. **Knowledge priming works at all levels.** The `${KNOWLEDGE}` template variable injects relevant facts from git sources and wiki layers regardless of the agent's mode.
6. **Brainstorm is always advisory.** It produces KB facts and beads, never GitHub issues or PRs. Its role evolves from inception (L1) to ongoing ideation (L2+), but its mode stays advisory at all levels.
7. **Telemetry and operations are L5/L6-only opt-in agents.** Below L5 they are absent from the pack roster and dashboard, do not spawn panes, and cannot be kicked. At L5–L6 they use a paused cadence in every governor mode until an operator opts in; they may open issues and PRs but never merge.

## Where ACMM gap issues are filed

The dashboard's ACMM evaluation lists each criterion a repo is missing, and
the level dialog offers **Open Issue** (per criterion) and **Open All** (every
failing criterion at that level). Both call `POST /api/acmm/issue`. By default
the issue goes to the repo's **GitHub Issues** with the `acmm` and
`ai-fix-requested` labels.

A hive whose backlog lives in Linear (`governor.work_source.type: linear`) can
file them there instead:

```yaml
governor:
  acmm:
    issue_tracker: work_source   # "" | github | work_source (default github)
```

| Value | Where the issue goes |
|---|---|
| `github` (or unset) | GitHub Issues on the criterion's repo — unchanged behavior. |
| `work_source` | Wherever the backlog lives. Linear work source → Linear `issueCreate` on the team whose `teams[].repo` matches the criterion's repo (else the first team). GitHub / GitHub Projects / Jira / unset → GitHub Issues as above. |

Any other value fails config validation at load time.

The choice can also be made **per click**: the request body accepts an
optional `tracker` field (`"github"` or `"work_source"`) that overrides the
configured default for that one issue; an unknown value is a `400`. When the
work source is Linear the level dialog shows a small **File in: GitHub /
Linear** selector, pre-selected from the config, that sets this field. The
response always says where the issue went:

```json
{"tracker": "linear", "issue_number": 42, "identifier": "ENG-42",
 "issue_url": "https://linear.app/acme/issue/ENG-42/...", "team": "ENG"}
```

(`tracker: "github"` responses carry `issue_number` and `issue_url` as
before.) `GET /api/acmm/evaluation` reports the effective default as
`issue_tracker` (`github` | `linear`) plus `work_source_type`. Title and body
are identical on both trackers; Linear uses `work_source.linear.api_key`, and
the audit log records `tracker` alongside the URL either way.

## Changing a hive's ACMM level

Promoting or demoting a running hive between levels is a single operation — the
hive reconciles its agent roster and per-agent modes to match the target level.

**From the dashboard:** open the Governor config and set the ACMM level. This is
the normal path.

**Over the API:** `PUT /api/packs/level` with `{"level": N}` where N is 1–6.

What happens when the level changes (`handlePackSetLevel` → `ApplyPack`):

1. The new level is written to `acmm_level` in `hive.yaml` and persisted.
2. Per-agent `mode` overrides are cleared so stale modes from the previous level
   are not re-applied on the next config reload.
3. `ApplyPack` cascades the target level's pack-defined agent fields (mode,
   `kick_template`, description, …) into the live config **and reconciles the
   roster** — adding every agent the level introduces (for example
   architect/strategist at higher levels) and applying each agent's mode for
   that level (advisory → measured → holdgated → full).

Notes:

- **Promotion adds agents and capability; demotion narrows it.** Moving up to L6
  makes agents auto-merge on green CI; moving down returns them to holdgated or
  advisory. The per-level capability grid is the table at the top of this page.
- **Operator-created agents are preserved.** `ApplyPack` reconciles pack agents;
  agents you created yourself are not removed by a level change (deletion is
  tombstoned separately — see agent configuration).
- On a hosted hive the level can also be hub/admin-managed; the ConfigMap seed is
  authoritative for `acmm_level` on those (see the operator reference on config
  precedence).

## Automated level-up guidance

A separate, advisory-only computation — the ACMM advisor (`pkg/acmmadvisor`) —
can tell you whether a hive has earned progression to the next level, based on
test coverage, green-CI streak, merge success rate, and backlog/hold signals.
It never changes the applied level itself; changing the level is always the
manual process described above. See the [ACMM advisor](https://github.com/kubestellar/hive/blob/v4/src/docs/acmm-advisor.md) page
for the exact thresholds per target level and what the `GET
/api/acmm-recommendation` endpoint returns.
