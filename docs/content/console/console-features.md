# KubeStellar Console Features

This guide covers the main features of the KubeStellar Console.

## Dashboard

The main dashboard provides a customizable view of your multi-cluster environment.

![Dashboard Overview](images/dashboard-overview.png)

### Stats Overview

The stats bar at the top of the dashboard displays key metrics:

- **Clusters**: Total cluster count and health status
- **Nodes**: Total nodes across all clusters
- **Pods**: Total pod count with status breakdown
- **AI Insights**: Security issues and recommended actions

### Dashboard Cards

Cards are the building blocks of the dashboard. Each card displays specific information about your clusters:

- Drag cards to reorder them
- Resize cards by adjusting their width
- Collapse cards to save space
- Use the AI button to get insights about card data

### Dashboard Templates

Pre-configured dashboard layouts for common use cases:

- **Operations**: Cluster health, deployments, events
- **GPU Monitoring**: GPU utilization, workloads, trends
- **Security**: OPA policies, alerts, vulnerabilities
- **GitOps**: Helm releases, drift detection, sync status

## Settings

The settings page allows you to configure all aspects of the console.

### AI Usage Mode

Control how much AI assistance you receive:

- **Low**: Direct kubectl commands, minimal token usage
- **Medium**: AI for analysis and suggestions
- **High**: Full AI assistance for all operations

### Local Agent

Connect to your local kubeconfig and Claude Code:

- View agent version and connection status
- See connected clusters
- Monitor token usage (session, daily, monthly)

### Update Channels

Choose your release channel:

- **Stable (Weekly)**: Tested releases every week
- **Nightly**: Latest features, updated daily

### Appearance

Customize the look and feel:

- Multiple themes: KubeStellar, Batman, Dracula, Nord, Tokyo Night, Cyberpunk, Matrix
- Visual effects: star field, glow effects, gradients
- Accessibility: color blind mode, reduce motion, high contrast

### Token Usage

Monitor and limit AI token consumption:

- Set monthly token limits
- Configure warning and critical thresholds
- Reset usage counters

## Navigation

The sidebar provides access to all major sections:

### Primary Navigation

- **Dashboard**: Main multi-cluster overview
- **Clusters**: Detailed cluster management
- **Workloads**: Deployments, pods, and jobs
- **Compute**: CPU, memory, and GPU resources
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes and claims
- **Network**: Services, ingresses, and network policies
- **Events**: Kubernetes event stream
- **Security**: Security posture and alerts
- **GitOps**: Helm, Kustomize, and ArgoCD

### Secondary Navigation

- **Card History**: Previously viewed cards
- **Namespaces**: Namespace management across clusters - create, view, and manage namespaces with intelligent error handling and offline cluster detection
- **User Management**: RBAC and access control
- **Settings**: Console configuration

### Special Sections

- **Arcade**: Games and entertainment
- **Deploy**: Multi-cluster deployment tools

## Search

The global search bar (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) enables quick navigation:

- Search clusters by name
- Find applications and pods
- Navigate to specific namespaces
- Filter by resource type

## Namespace Management

The Namespace Management page (`/namespaces`) provides a centralized interface for managing namespaces across all your clusters.

### Key Features

- **Direct Agent Access**: Namespace data is fetched directly from the local agent, providing faster response times and bypassing potential backend authentication issues
- **Smart Caching**: Intelligently caches namespace data while preventing empty states from being persisted on temporary failures
- **Offline Cluster Handling**: Clearly identifies offline clusters in the header without redundant error messages
- **Filtered Creation**: The Create Namespace dialog automatically filters out offline clusters, ensuring namespace creation only targets available clusters
- **Intelligent Error Display**: Error banners only appear when ALL clusters fail to respond, not on partial failures

### Creating Namespaces

To create a new namespace:

1. Navigate to `/namespaces`
2. Click the "Create" button (sized appropriately for UI consistency)
3. Select one or more online clusters from the dialog
4. Enter the namespace name
5. Confirm to create the namespace across selected clusters

Note: The create dialog only displays clusters that are currently online and responsive, preventing failed creation attempts.

### Cluster Status Indicators

- **Online clusters**: Show namespace lists and are available for namespace creation
- **Offline clusters**: Marked clearly in the header with offline status indicators
- **Partial failures**: Do not trigger error banners; only complete failures across all clusters show errors

## Alerts

The alert system keeps you informed:

- Real-time notifications for critical events
- Configurable alert rules
- Integration with external notification systems
- Alert history and acknowledgment

## AI Missions

AI-powered automation for common tasks:

### Starting a Mission

Missions can be started from:

- **Card AI buttons**: Click the AI icon on any card
- **Stats bar actions**: Click "Address Security Issues" or similar action buttons
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Press `M` to open the missions panel

### Mission Types

- **Security Analysis**: Investigate security issues and vulnerabilities
- **Performance Investigation**: Analyze slow pods or resource constraints
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug failing deployments or pods
- **Remediation**: Apply fixes for common problems

### AI Provider Configuration

The console supports multiple AI backends:

![API Key Settings](images/api-key-settings.png)

- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Primary AI backend with API access
- **Claude Code (Local)**: Uses your local Claude Code installation for missions
- **GPT-4 (OpenAI)**: Alternative LLM backend
- **Gemini (Google)**: Alternative LLM backend

Configure API keys in Settings > AI Provider Keys or click the key icon in the header.

## Offline Detection

The Offline Detection card monitors node and GPU health:

![Offline Detection Card](images/offline-detection-card.png)

### Features

- **Node Monitoring**: Detects nodes with NotReady status
- **GPU Tracking**: Identifies GPU nodes reporting 0 available GPUs
- **Health Summary**: Shows count of offline nodes and GPU issues
- **AI Analysis**: Click "Analyze Issues" to start an AI mission investigating problems

### Status Indicators

- **All Healthy**: Green status when no issues detected
- **Issues Found**: Red/orange status with counts of affected resources
- **Drill-Down**: Click counts to navigate to affected resources

## Deploy Page

The Deploy page provides tools for managing deployments across clusters.

![Deploy Page](images/deploy-page.png)

### Deployment Cards

2. Drag to target clusters on the world map
3. Configure namespace and replicas
4. Preview changes before applying
