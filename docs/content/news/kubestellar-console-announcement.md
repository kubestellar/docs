# KubeStellar Console Is Ready for You to Try

*February 2026*

Hello KubeStellar community — hope you are all enjoying your week.

I'm excited to share that **KubeStellar Console** is ready for you to try! Whether you want to kick the tires online or run it locally, we've made it easy to get started.

---

## Try It Now

**No install required** — just visit:
[https://console.kubestellar.io](https://console.kubestellar.io)

**Or run it locally in under a minute:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubestellar/console/main/start.sh | bash
```

That's it — one command, no dependencies beyond curl. It downloads the console and a lightweight local agent, starts both, and opens your browser. The local agent reads your kubeconfig to connect to your clusters — it runs on your machine, for your personal use only. Nothing leaves your laptop.

## What Is It?

KubeStellar Console is a multi-cluster Kubernetes dashboard that's AI-powered and adapts to how you work. It's multi-cluster from day&nbsp;one — OpenShift, EKS, GKE, kind, k3s, whatever you have in your kubeconfig shows up automatically.

## Highlights

- **AI-personalized dashboard** — answer a few onboarding questions and Console builds a dashboard for your role (SRE, DevOps, platform engineer, developer)
- **AI Missions** — let AI observe patterns across your clusters and proactively surface issues, suggest optimizations, and restructure your dashboard as your focus changes
- **Deploy across clusters** — deploy apps, Helm charts, and kustomize overlays to multiple clusters from one place
- **170+ dashboard cards** — cluster health, GPU monitoring, GitOps drift, RBAC explorer, security scanning, cost analysis, and more
- **Real-time streaming** — live event feeds and SSE-powered data from all clusters
- **Looks great** — dark mode, smooth animations, responsive layout. We spent a lot of time on the UX

## Bug Bounty Program

We have a rewards program! Open issues and feature requests directly through the Console UI (look for the feedback button) and earn bounty rewards. Your feedback directly shapes the roadmap.
